# (Pseudo-) Riemmanian metrics on manifolds

Topics to be discussed:
* Definition of metric as section in the tensor bundle of bilinear forms
* Definition of symmetry, non-degenericity
* Identification of TM and T*M (musical isomorphisms) induced by g
* Isometries Isom(M,g) and Isotropy Isom_0(M,g,x)
* Definition of homogenous manifolds

* Levi-Civita?

Requires:
* manifolds.md
